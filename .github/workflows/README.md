# Azure Cloud and GitHub Actions
The topic of this presentation is GitHub Actions. The goal is to show some of the basic functionality. In order to accomplish, I'm deplopying the application and its current ""infrastructure" to Azure

Just make note that if you would like to fork this repo, you're going to need some Azure compute and some credentials.
Also worth noting that I am using a custom Docker image for the jobs in the GitHub workflow. So you'd need the credentials to my registery. 
I'll probably parameterize that in the yaml file so you can substitute your own registry and credentials, but it's a very simple change if you want to try it in your own repo. 
You might be interested in these links if you ever use GHA:
- I make use of the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) for interaction with Azure. It is included in the dev image / CI image.
- GitHub Action Workflow Syntax [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
- VSCode [ARM Templates Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools) is helpful for working with ARM templates

# This is sandbox
I'm using this as a sandbox to learn. It's a work in progress, and I welcome any suggestions/participation.
This repo does not have the purpose of being a blueprint for anything. It does not have the same burdens/responsibiities as the ALM Example App repos for example.

### RBAC / "CIServicePrincipal"
My workflows need to run in a context that gives them proper permissions to my Azure tenant.

```
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name CIServicePrincipal --role Contributor

az login --service-principal --username <github secret> --password <github secret> --tenant <github secret>

az account set --subscription <github secret>
```


### Summary of this workflow

```
az deployment group create 
  --name addwebapp 
  --resource-group TechExchangeDemoGroup 
  --template-file  /path/to/infra.json 
  --parameters storagePrefix=dubsalot storageSKU=Standard_LRS webAppName=dubsalot

dotnet publish --output cibuild

cd cibuild

az webapp up --runtime "DOTNETCORE|3.1" --os Linux --name dubsalot --debug
```

- The workflow is stored in .github/main.yml
- The jobs in the build depend on a custom container I use for dev tools. You can find that docker file under .ci/
- The jobs pull dubsalot.azurecr.io/ci/azure from an my personal Azure Container Registry

The credentials are stored in GitHub Action Secrets:
- AZ_SVC_PRINCIPAL_UN: ${{ secrets.AZ_SVC_PRINCIPAL_UN }}
- AZ_SVC_PRINCIPAL_PW: ${{ secrets.AZ_SVC_PRINCIPAL_PW }}


###  dubsalot.azurecr.io/ci/azure
I don't like how long it takes to initialize a container for each job. It's _probably_ not a big deal in real world scenarios. I just feel that they could potentially build an image for JobA when JobB is running: At least some sort of deterministic strategy..

[Eyar Zilberman](https://www.datree.io/resources/github-actions-best-practices) @ datree.io touches on this in a write-up he did for "best practices"


# Composite actions
[Composites](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-run-steps-action) allow one to group a series of steps into one action. For example, a common pattern in your workflows is: step1, step2, step3 then step4. In this scenario, it possibly makes sense to put those 4 steps in a composite action. Your main workflow will now execute the composite action.


### on that note..

There is a thing called [Azure Stack](https://github.com/Azure/login#sample-azure-login-workflow-that-to-run-az-cli-on-azure-stack-hub/?WT.mc_id=devopslab-c9-cxa) that simplifies interaction with Azure cloud from GHA. For example, it probably makes sense to use the [azure/login@releases/v1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/user/ci-cd-github-action-login-cli?WT.mc_id=devopslab-c9-cxa&view=azs-2008) instead of calling **az login**


On one hand, what I did using the az CLI was simple enough and it was good for me personally speaking to start with learning basics.
On the other, it makes a lot of sense to use the "official" components designed for this scenario.


# Quickstart Workflows
GitHub offers [guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides) on pre-built [quickstart templates](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows) for many common ci/cd patters.


# Feedback
I'd like some feedback from devs and people with more docker/ocp experience. A loose idea/direction I am playing with is to use the same container image that runs my dev environment for the CI/CD portion of the workflows. This is the image from [part 1](https://github.com/dubsalot/vscode-container-demo/tree/series/part-1-vscode-container) of this series. Seems a little funky having vscode in a container used in a pipeline, but I still haven't convinced myself it's a bad idea.

As of now, it's essentially the same image. The Dockerfile for the image (dubsalot.azurecr.io/ci/azure) was copied from the vscode demo
